<h5> What is PlanVIEW?</h5>

<b>PlanVIEW</b> is an all-in-one school app. Take <em> quick notes </em> and <em> access your teacher's websites</em> in a clean and simple user interface. Let's get started with the simple setup.
<br>
<br>

<h5>Links Setup</h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>Press the (menu) button in  the top left of the app</li>

<li>Scroll down to the tab that says <em>Settings</em> and press it </li>

<li>Next, go to your browser on your phone (Chrome or Safari) and open up your First Block Teacher's Website. Copy the link from the address bar.</li>

<li>Go back to the PlanVIEW app and in the <em>Settings</em>, paste the link in the box that says <em>1st Block Website Link</em></li>

<li>Do it this for the rest of your classes.</li>

<li>Click Save. You should get message that says Settings Saved </li>
</ol>

<br>

    <blockquote>
			<b>Important Note</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			If your class doesn't have a website or you do not use the website, you MUST still put a link of a website in that box. It can be important websites you visit or something like google.com.
		 The option for Off-block or No Links will be available in our PRO Version    </blockquote>
<br>
Now, if you ever have to go to your teacher's website quickly then you can click (menu) button and then the  tab you need instead of searching for it on your browser
